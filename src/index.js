//ToDo objects should have properties such as title, description, duedate, priority.
//Notes and checklist would be nice too.

//Pojects should hold lists of ToDo objects. There should be a default project
//users can add ToDo objects to. Users should be able to create new projects
//and choose which their todos go.

//Users should be able to: view all projects, view all todos in each project,
//expand a todo to see/edit, and delete Todos.

//May want to use date-fns.

//use local storage!
